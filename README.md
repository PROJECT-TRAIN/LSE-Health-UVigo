The LSE-Health-UVigo dataset is a collection of 273 videos focused on health-related topics, presented in Spanish Sign Language (Lengua de Signos Espa√±ola, LSE). The dataset offers comprehensive annotations and alignments for various linguistic elements within the videos.

## Overview

- **Total Videos**: 273
- **Total Duration**: 11 hours

A previous version of this dataset with less videos and annotations was distributed for the [2022 Sign Spotting Challenge at ECCV](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.cat/challenge/49/description/) The description of the former dataset, LSE_eSaude_UVIGO (ECCV'22) can be found [here](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.cat/dataset/42/description/) including the train/val/test splits for the two organized tracks (MSSL-multiple shot supervised learning, and OSLWL-one shot learning and weak labels). The results of the challenge with the description of the dataset, protocols and baseline models, as well as discussing top-winning solutions and future directions on the topic can be found in this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-25085-9_13)
